# Annotations

Hello :D

In this repository, we are exploring how annotations work in Java (Maven).
We are trying to create an annotation, register it, and use the result of the
processed annotation, which in this case, is a custom toString() method.

There are currently 3 different methods that we are exploring:
1. Replacing the .java file using the annotation processor
2. Generating a new file in generated-sources
3. Using a third-party library (Google's Auto Service)

You can see the results of each method in the respective modules
